\chapter{Introduction}

\par The goal of this paper is to apply Topological Data Analysis (TDA) methods to geometric features of 3-dimensional data from STL files generated by a CAD (Computer-Aided Design) program to measure potential dimensional errors in tolerances and clearances which can frequently arise in manufacturing methods such as 3D printing. A part's topology can be analyzed to obtain metrics that can help identify the margin of error in its features. The possible tolerances of a part can be represented by alternate 3D files which are variations of the part's features. While there are many simple and complex features a 3D part can have, we will observe differences in the topology of hole diameters, distances between two separate objects, and two different features that come together which are attached to the same object. These variations in tolerances will result in different birth and death values in its persistent homology which can be observed through a "movie" of persistence diagrams.
\par TDA is a set of methods in applied mathematics that use topology to understand the shape of data through transformations into simplicial complexes which allow us to visualize features in the data such as possible connected components, holes, and voids. We can further transform data into a filtered simplicial complex which will allow us to observe its persistent homology and track changes in its homology over a "time", which can be considered as changes in filtration values. For the purposes of this paper, we will only be focusing on connected components and holes. 
\par The sample STL file data used for this paper was generated in FreeCAD and then exported to ASCII STL files, but the methods of this paper can be applied to 3D files generated by any program. The \verb"MeshPy" Python library was used to create Delaunay meshes of each STL file, and the \verb"Gudhi" Python library was used to create filtered simplicial complexes and to generate the persistence points of the Alpha complex of the meshes. We then visualized connected components and holes represented by the $H_0$ and $H_1$ homology of varitions of three 3D object cases. The persistence diagrams were then generated which showed the progression of change in topological features in the 3D object's mesh over "time" as variations changed.
\section{Related Works}

\par Applications of topology and homology exist in meshing and finite element modeling (FEM) - triangulation, cad analysis, fem, etc. Homology is a fundamental building block of TDA with applications in meshing and analyzing simplicial data. Homology has many possible applications itself, especially in the field of computational geometry: it can be integrated into finite mesh element solvers such as Gmsh \cite{homology_fem_computation}, combined with computational geometry to create meshing algorithms \cite{3d_vol_iso_mesh}, and used to simplify high-dimensional simplicial shapes for easier analysis \cite{efficient_homology_preserving}\cite{mesh_enhanced_persistent}. Some papers more closely related to the work in this thesis are (topology of skeletons and offsets \cite{efficient_homology_preserving})
\chapter{Background}

\par Homology is used to detect the holes present in a shape through the use of simplicial complexes. Before defining a simplex and simplicial complex, fundamental preliminary definitions need to be shown to understand simplicial homology and persistent homology \cite{Needham_2019}.

\begin{definition}[Field]
A field is a set $\mathbb{F}$ endowed with operations addition,$+$, and multiplication,$\bullet$, respectively satistying the following axioms for all $a,b,c\in\mathbb{F}$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item (Identity) $\exists$ an \textit{additive identity}, $0_{\mathbb{F}}$ s.t. $a+0_{\mathbb{F}}=a$ and a \textit{multiplicative identity} denoted $1_{\mathbb{F}}$ s.t. $1_{\mathbb{F}}\bullet a = a$.
\item (Associativity) Addition and multiplication are associative:
\begin{itemize}
\item $(a+b) + c = a + (b+c)$
\item $(a\bullet b) \bullet c = a \bullet (b \bullet c)$
\end{itemize}
\item (Commutativity) Addition and multiplication are commutative:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a + b = b + a$
\item $a \bullet b = b \bullet a$
\end{itemize}
\item (Inverses) Each $a \in \mathbb{F}$ has \textit{additive inverses} denoted $-a$ s.t. $a + (-a) = 0_{\mathbb{F}}$ and, excluding $0_\mathbb{F}$, a \textit{multiplicative inverse} denoted $a^{-1}$ s.t. $a \bullet a^{-1}=1_\mathbb{F}$.
\item (Distributivity) Multiplication distributes over addition:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a \bullet (b+c) = (a \bullet b) + (a \bullet c)$
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Free Vector Space]
\par Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field and let $S$ be a finite set. The \textit{free vector space} over $\mathbb{F}$ on the set $S$ is the vector space $V_{\mathbb{F}}(S)$ (or $V(S)$ when the field is fixed) with underyling set consisting of functions $\phi: S \rightarrow F$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Convex]
\par A subset of a set $S$ of $\mathbb{R}^m$ is \textit{convex} if for any points $x, y \in S$, each point $(1-t)x+ty, t\in [0,1]$, along the interpolation between $x$ and $y$ is also contained in $S$..
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Convex Hull]
\par The \textit{convex hull} of a set $S$ is the smallest convex subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$ which contains $S$ and is denoted $cvx(S)$:
$$cvx(S) = \bigcap\{C \mid S\subset C \subset \mathbb{R}^m \text{and } C \text{ is convex}\}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Affine Subspace]
\par An \textit{affine subspace} of $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a set of the form
$x+V = \{x + v \mid v\in V\}$ where $V\subset\mathbb{R}^m$ is a vector subspace.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[General Position]
Let $S=\{x_0, x_1, ..., x_n\}$ be a finite subset of $\mathbb{R}^m$. $S$ is in \textit{general position} if its points are not contained in any affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ of dimension less than $n$ where $n\leq m$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Open Metric Ball]
\par An \textit{open metric ball} in a metric space $(X, d)$, notated $B_{d}(x, r)$, is defined for a center point $x\in X$ and a radius $r>0$ to be the set:
$$B_{r}(X) = \{y\in X \mid d(x,y)<r\}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Voronoi Cell]
\label{def:voronoi}
\par For a finite metric space $(X, d)$, for each $x\in X$, the \textit{Voronoi cell} of $x$ is the set:
$$\mathsf{Vor}(x) = \{y\in Y \mid d(x,y) \leq d(x', y) \forall x' \in X\}$$
\end{definition}

\section{Simplicial Homology}

\par Simplicial homology analyzes shapes of dimension $m$ through combinations of fundamental components such as points, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, and so on.

\begin{definition}[Simplex]
\par For a set $S$ of $n$ points in general position, an $(n-1)$-dimensional \textit{simplex}, $\sigma(S)$, associated to $S$ is formed by the convex hull of $S$, $cvx(S)$.
\end{definition}

\par For our purposes, we will only be working over $\mathbb{F}_2$ with 0, 1, 2, and 3-simplices. A 0-simplex is a point; a 1-simplex is an edge; a 2-simplex is a 'filled-in' triangle, or the convex hull of a triangle; and a 3-simplex is a 'filled-in/solid' tetrahedron, or the convex hull of a tetrahedron.

\begin{definition}[Geometric Simplicial Complex]
\par A \textit{geometric simplicial complex} is a collection of simplicies $\mathcal{X}$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$ satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item for any simplex $\sigma \in \mathcal{X}$, all faces of $\sigma$ are also contained in $\mathcal{X}$.
\item for any two simplices $\sigma, \tau \in \mathcal{X}$, the intersection $\sigma \cup \tau$ is also a simplex and which is a face of both $
\sigma$ and $\tau$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Abstract Simplicial Complex]
\par An \textit{abstract simplicial complex} is a pair $X = (V(X), \Sigma(X))$, also notated $X=(V,\Sigma)$, where $V(X)$, the vertices of $X$, is a finite set and $\Sigma(X)$, the simplices (or faces) of $X$, is a collection of subsets of $V(X)$ such that for any $\sigma \in \Sigma(X)$ and any nonempty $\tau \subset \sigma, \tau \in \Sigma(X)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item Faces containing exactly two vertices are \textit{edges}
\item Faces containing exactly $(k+1)$-vertices are $k$\textit{-dimensional faces} (or $k$\textit{-faces}).
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Chain Group]
\par The $k$\textit{-th} \textit{chain group} $C_k(X)$ of $\mathcal{X}$ over $F_2$, or $C_k$ when the simplicial complex $\mathcal{X}$ is fixed, is the free vector space over $F_2$ generated by the set of $k$\textit{-dimensional} simplices of $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Boundary Map]
\par The \textit{boundary map}, $\partial_{k}$, of a simplicial complex, $X$, whose simplicies are of dimension at most $m$, defined on basis elements $\sigma$ is:
$$\partial_{k}(\sigma)=\sum^{k}_{j=0}\partial^{j}_{k}(\sigma)$$
where $\partial^{j}_{k}$ is a $(k-1)$\textit{-dimensional} face of $sigma$. $\partial_{k}$ takes a $k$-simplex to the sum of $(k-1)$-simplices which lie along its boundary. It can also be expressed as:
$$\partial_{k}(\sigma)=\sum^{k}_{j=0}\big\{\tau \mid \tau \text{ is a }(k-1)\text{-dimensional face of } \sigma \big\}$$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Cycle]
\par A \textit{cycle}, $Z_{k}(X)$ or $Z_k$, is the kernel of the boundary map $\partial_{k}$. The elements of $Z_k$ are reffered to as $k$\textit{-cycles}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Boundary]
\par A \textit{boundary}, $B_{k}(X)$ or $B_k$, is the image of the boundary map $\partial_{k+1}$. The elements of $B_k$ are reffered to as $k$\textit{-boundaries}
\end{definition}

\par Through building on the previous definitions, we are finally ready to define homology groups through the use of cycles and boundaries.

\begin{definition}[Homology Group]
\par The $k$\textit{-th} \textit{homology group} of $\mathcal{X}$ is the quotient space $H_k(X) = Z_{k}(X)/B_{k}(X)$.
\end{definition}

\par Different homology groups give us information about different features in $\mathcal{X}$. $H_{0}$ describes the number of connected components, $H_{1}$ describes the number of holes, and $H_{2}$ describes the number of voids.

\section{Persistent Homology}
\par Persistent homology measures the change in homology of features over "time", or marked events used to keep track of the changes. Persistence diagrams keep track of the persistence points that arise over the course of these changes through recording birth and death moments of simplicies in the complex.

\begin{definition}[Filtered Simplicial Complex]
\par A \textit{filtered simplicial complex} is a collection of $\mathsf{K}=\{K_{r}\}_{r\geq 0}$ of (finite) simplicial complexes $K_{r}$ and a family of simplicial maps $f_{r, r'}: V(K_{r})\rightarrow V(K_{r'})$ for each pair $(r, r')$ with $r \leq r'$. The simplicial maps must satisfy the compatibility condition: for all $r\leq r'\leq r''$, we have $f_{r, r''} = f_{r'', r'} \circ {f_{r', r}}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Persistence Diagram]
\label{def:persdia}
\par The Fundamental Theorem of Persistent Homology, created by Afra Zomorodian and Gunnar Carlsson\cite{computpershom}, states that an input of a filtered simplicial complex, $K_t$,  $K_{1} \subseteq K_{2} \subseteq ... \subseteq K_{t}$ where $0\leq t_{1} \leq ... \leq t_{n} $, gives a basis of homology groups, $H_{k}$, $H_{K}(K_{1}) \rightarrow H_{K}(K_{2}) \rightarrow ...\rightarrow H_{K}(K_{t})$ by induced maps on homology $i_{1*}, ..., i_{t*}$ such that each basis element has a well-defined birth time, $b$, and death time, $d$.
\par The \textit{persistence diagram} is obtained from the multiset of these births and deaths, $\{(b_{j},d_{j})\}^{M}_{j=1}$, by plotting each point in the xy-plane (recording multiplicity as necessary). Since $b_{j} < d_{j}$ for each j, the points all appear above the diagonal line $x=y$.
\end{definition}

\par There are many different ways to create a filtered simplicial complex. We will define four methods we can use in order to create the complex. The Čech complex is the base complex we will build off of.

\begin{definition}[Čech Complex]
Let $(X)$ be a finite metric space. The \textit{Čech complex}, $\mathsf{C}_r$, can be associated to a simplicial complex, $X$, where open metric balls grow around points of the metric space. With each intersection of $k+1$ balls, add a $k$\textit{-dimensional} simplex to the filtered simplicial complex.\\
$$\mathsf{C}_{r}(X) = \{\sigma \subseteq X \mid \cap_{x \in \sigma} B_{r}(X) \not= \emptyset\}$$
\end{definition}

\par The Vietoris-Rips complex expands upon the Čech complex by introducing a fixed radius.

\begin{definition}[Vietoris-Rips Complex]
Let $(X, d)$ be a finite metric space. The \textit{Vietoris-Rips complex} at parameter $r$, $\mathsf{VR}(X, r)$, for each real number $r\geq0$, can be associated to a simplicial complex, $X$, where:
$$\mathsf{VR}(X, r) = (V_{r}, \Sigma_{r})\text{, }V_{r}=X\text{ for all }r\text{, }\Sigma_{r} = \{\sigma \subset X \mid d(x,y) \leq r\text{ }\forall x, y \in \sigma\}$$
\end{definition}

\newpage 
\begin{example}[Vietoris-Rips Complex applied to a Point Cloud]
\par The Vietoris-Rips complex grows an open metric ball around each point in a dataset up to a radius, $r$. As the balls intersect, a connection between the two points that the balls came from is created. These connections continue to form until the balls are fully grown to $r$, where the simplicial complex is in its final state.

\end{figure}
\end{example}

\begin{example}[Persistence Diagram of a Vietoris-Rips Complex of a Point Cloud]
This example uses a randomly generated point cloud to create a persistence diagram from a Vietoris-Rips complex. When $r=0.5$, the persistence diagram shows three points at $d=\infty$ for $H_0$. This corresponds to the three connected components in the filtered simplicial complex. The points below infinity on the $y$-axis show the death times of points as they get added to one of the three connected components. Notice how there are only points on the $y$-axis: as Figure \ref{fig:point_cloud_radii} shows, all points are present when $r=0$, this means each point in the complex has a birth time of $0$.

\end{example}

\newpage
\par The Čech and Vietoris-Rips complexes can be very computationally expensive, so an alternative filtered simplicial complex, the Alpha Complex, will need to be applied to the STL file data. Before we can define the Alpha Complex, we need to define an essential component of it, the Delaunay Triangulation.

\begin{definition}[Delaunay Triangulation] A \textit{Delaunay triangulation} is a unique triangulation on a vector space which is formed by creating a connection between points whenever their Voronoi cells (Def \ref{def:voronoi}) intersect \cite{deltri}. This triangulation is the dual of its Voronoi cells.
\end{definition}
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.35\textwidth}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Plot of a Delaunay Complex and Voronoi Cells applied to a point cloud.}
    \label{fig:point_cloud_del_voronoi}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Gabriel]
When a mesh is created with a Delaunay Triangulation, certain edges in the triangulation can be considered \textit{Gabriel} when the open ball of the triangulated edge is empty of points \cite{gabriel}. However, not every edge in a triangulation needs to be considered Gabriel for it to be considered Delaunay. In $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the figure below shows that every open ball, or circumcircle, of an edge contains no inner points.
\end{definition}
\begin{figure}[H]

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{A Gabriel graph compared to a graph which cannot be Gabriel.}
    \label{fig:good_bad_gabriel}
\end{figure}

\begin{definition}[Alpha Complexes]
The Alpha complex (or $\alpha$-complex) exists within a finite metric space $(X, d)$ which is isometrically embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{m}$ (or another larger metric space, $(Y, d)$) with Euclidean distance. The alpha complex builds upon the Delaunay Triangulation with its use of Voronoi cells by introducing a radius parameter for an open metric ball. 
$$\alpha_{r}(X)=\{\sigma \subseteq X \mid \cap_{x\in \sigma} (B_{r}(X) \cap \mathsf{Vor}_{x}) \not= \emptyset\}$$
At $r=0$, the filtered simplicial complex consists only of the set of points in the metric space as individual connected components. As $r$ increases, the balls grow up to the boundary of or beyond their Voronoi cell. When two balls intersect, a connected component between those two points is formed. This continues until $r$ grows to create a simplex equivalent to the Delaunay triangulation.
\end{definition}

\par The Alpha complex is the ideal filtered simplicial complex to use when analyzing the homology of 3D objects as it can show us when connected components and holes are born and die in the persistent homology of the object while the growth of $r$ is self-contained to the maximum diameter of the object. The end growth point of the object's Delaunay triangulation also allows for the Alpha complex to be the least computationally expensive persistent homology method of the three we have defined.

\newpage
\begin{example}[Alpha Complex applied to a Point Cloud]\label{ex:point_cloud_alpha}
\par This example shows an Alpha complex created with the python library \verb"Gudhi", which defines its growing radii parameter as $r^{2}$ to birth and death times. To understand events at certain radii, we denote plots with $r^{2}$ for birth and death times, and $r$ for Euclidean distance.
\par Two holes were created with birth times of $r^{2}=0.2308$ and $r^{2}=0.3068$. The first hole dies at $r^{2}=0.8045$. To understand why the second hole dies relatively quickly at $r^{2}=0.3069$, we can compare it to the filled-in triangle formed between $r^{2} = 0.23084$ and $r^{2} = 0.29$. The points of the triangle which make up the second hole have voronoi cells which intersect close to or exactly at the intersection point of all three voronoi cells. As one of the three balls grows slightly, the hole gets filled in $r^{2}=0.0001$ later. Three voronoi cells of points from the filled-in triangle all intersect at different times, creating the filled-in triangle instantly upon the third intersection.

\begin{example}[Persistence Diagram of an Image]
\par This example uses a grayscale image of a white square with a black circle in the center to create a persistence diagram from an Alpha complex. Although the image seems like a bullet point in a blank area, thanks to the nature of the grayscale data, the white pixels in the image contain values of 1 and the black pixels contain no data, or values of 0. In other words, the black circle is a hole in the data.
\par This hole can be seen as a point in $H_1$ with a birth time of 0 and a radius of 10 pixels. As $r$ increases to a Euclidean distance of 10, the hole gets filled in because balls on the circumference of the black hole finally intersect. The intersection at $r=10$ is shown as a death time of ${r}^2 = 100$.
\par On a persistence diagram, in most cases, the points along or relatively close to the diagonal line which are not on the $y$-axis can be considered noise and disregarded.

\section{Background on the STL Filetype}
\par An STL file is a filetype created for use with 3D data generated by computer-aided design (CAD) programs for 3D printing and other rapid-prototyping applications. STL is ancronym which can be an abbreviation for Stereolithography, Standard Triangle Language, or Standard Tesselation Language. These files are built through triangulation: every set of points creates a triangle which acts as a facet of the object. These triangles are 'filled-in' 2-simplices, and will be fundamental in analyzing the topology of STL files. In terms of the contents of an ASCII STL file, a facet should not be confused with a face: a facet must be a triangle, while a face of a polyhedron can be subdivided into multiple facets to achieve triangulation. The information in an STL file can be encoded using binary or in ASCII as a \verb".ast" (ASCII STL) file. For our purposes, we will be using \verb".ast" files to extract and analyze 3D object data. \cite{analysis_of_stl}

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:ast_tetrahedron}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-7.5mm}

\par STL files contain descriptions of individual vertices, each of which are encapsulated its facet with its normal vector, as seen in the example tetrahedron, Fig \ref{fig:ast_tetrahedron}. The contents of an STL file do not specify topological information, such as connections to other vertices, which vertices make up a face, etc. Instead, STL files describe each vertex as many times as it appears in the file until the overall shape is built.

\par To analyze the topological data within STL files, we can parse the \verb".ast" files for four strings which are used to denote the beginning and end of the description of facets and vertices: 'facet normal', 'end facet', 'outer loop', and 'end loop', respectively. The data between these strings was then converted into a tuple using python.


\chapter{Methods}\label{chap:methods}
\section{Main Method}
\subsection{Creating a Mesh from an STL file}
\label{sec:mesh_from_stl}
\par To compute the persistence of the variations of the "truth" of an STL file, the data must be processed and transformed with meshing in order to be properly analyzed. Although STL files contain a mesh upon creation, this mesh is not adequate for our purposes as the triangulated mesh an STL file contains is not necessarily a Delaunay triangulation.
\par The completed Alpha complex of a mesh is a Delaunay triangulation. We require the 3D object's original mesh to be Delaunay because in the next step of our method we will alter the filtered simplicial complex based on the data of the initial simplicial complex, $K_{0}$.
\par $K_{0}$ will be compared with the Alpha complexes as $r^2$ grows to include new simplices. Without $K_0$ being Delaunay, our filtration and subsequent persistence analysis may show incorrect results. We will call a simplex a \textit{Delaunay simplex} if it is contained in the Delaunay triangulation of the vertices of the mesh. A simplicial complex is called a \textit{sub-Delaunay complex} if every simplex in it is Delaunay.
\subsection{Creating and modifying an Alpha Complex}
\label{sec:modify_alpha_complex}
\par Now we are ready to generate an Alpha complex. The sub-Delaunay complex mesh $K_{0}$, created by the Delaunay triangulation, contains every edge and triangle present in the original 3D object mesh while retaining its boundaries, so the topology is not altered as it will be with the Alpha complex. The sub-Delaunay $K_{0}$ is a subset of the completed Alpha complex, therefore every simplex present in the $K_{0}$ complex is present as a simplex in the Alpha complex.
\par The Alpha complex grows to include simplices which were not originally in the $K_{0}$ sub-Delaunay complex. These Alpha complex simplices are checked against the $K_{0}$ simplices to determine which simplices were present originally. All simplices that were present originally will be given a new filtration value of 0 to denote they appear in the $K_{0}$ complex. Replacing the filtration values in this way is done to ensure the original simplices from $K_{0}$ have a corresponding birth time of $b=0$, while all new simplices created by the Alpha complex will retain their assigned $r^{2}$ filtration.

\subsection{Computing a Persistence Diagram}
\label{sec:compute_persdia}
\par Now that we have created and reassigned the appropriate filtration values that make up our filtered simplicial complex, we compute a persistence diagram using Def \ref{def:persdia}. We then create persistence diagrams of each variation of the 3D object to see the progression of its homology over the changes to a feature or features of a part. The death axes on the sequence of persistence diagrams are constrained to the maximum death time within the sequence to keep the plots consistent and monitor its change over the variations.

\begin{example}[Example of Methods with a Single 3D Object]
\par The figures below show the progression of transformations to the STL file data. Initially, the object is loaded in and parsed to create the 3D plot of its original mesh in Fig \ref{fig:initial_stl}. Then, the data is meshed to create a Delaunay Triangulation (additional points are added to the mesh which will be expanded on in Sec \ref{sec:implement_meshpy}) in Fig \ref{fig:meshpy_of_stl}. Finally, we compare the simplices in \ref{fig:meshpy_of_stl} to the simplices in the alpha complex of the meshed 3D object and plot its persistence in \ref{fig:persdia_of_stl} to show 1 connected component in $H_{0}$ and 1 hole in $H_{1}$.

    \caption{A triangular prism with a triangular hole, its Delaunay triangulated mesh, and the persistence diagram of the Delaunay triangulated mesh}
    \label{fig:image_data_persdia}
\end{figure}
\noindent We will implement this method on sequences of variations of part features in three cases of 3D objects to show the topological effect on the tolerancing in the progression of change in the objects.
\end{example}

\section{Implementation}

\par The methods of this paper are implemented in Python using many libraries, most notably \verb"MeshPy" for mesh creation, \verb"Gudhi" for TDA, \verb"Plotly" to visualize 3D plots, and \verb"Matplotlib" to visualize persistence diagrams.

\subsection{Creating STL Files with FreeCAD}
\par STL files from online sources such as Thingiverse can be processed through the program, but these files are often too complex and therefore very computationally expensive. For this reason, we create our own dataset to test our methods using FreeCAD to keep complexity to a minimum while covering basic test cases that demonstrate potential tolerancing errors. The parts are all exported to an ASCII STL (\verb".ast") which encodes the data as text to allow for the data to be easily read in by Python.

\subsection{Parsing the STL File Data}
\par We will discuss two methods to load in the data an ASCII STL file. We can parse data directly from the \verb".ast" file and load it into lists and tuples, or we can use the \verb"load_stl()" attribute of the \verb"MeshPy" \verb"MeshInfo" object.

\par For "simplicity", we will use the \verb"load_stl()" attribute. To use this method with a \verb".ast" file, we will pass in the full file path of the \verb".ast" file, but first we must use Python to create a temporary copy with the extension renamed to \verb".stl" even though the content of the file will stil be ASCII text. Without creating a temporary copy that renames the \verb".ast" to \verb".stl", \verb"load_stl()" will not work. This temporary \verb".stl" file is then passed in to \verb"load_stl()" to create our \verb"MeshInfo" object which will be used to build the new Delaunay triangulation mesh.

\par Although we use \verb"MeshPy" to load in the data, the following paragraph is an example of how ASCII STL file data could be loaded in if we wanted to do it manually. Loading in the code manually can be advantageous if we want to directly alter the ASCII STL data of the chosen "truth" \verb".ast" file to create variations of part features by manipulating the facets and vertices and saving these manipulations as new \verb".ast" files to be analyzed sequentially.

\par As shown in Fig \ref{fig:ast_tetrahedron}, an ASCII STL file is delimited by the formatting of its facets and vertices. We use the strings 'facet normal', 'end facet', 'outer loop', 'end loop', and newline character delimiters to identify the faces and vertices of the 3D object. For each facet, the ASCII data gives us the normal vector of the facet and the coordinates of each of the three points that makes up the facet. At this point, we can use the parsed data to add or manipulate points, edges, or facets if we choose to do so. We can then use the parsed or manipulated data to create a list of points where each unique point is numbered numerically. All point names would be 1-indexed, or begin naming at 1. The list of unique edges can be extracted from the list of facets and matched with their vertex names to create a list of edges described by two vertex names instead of coordinates. The same can be done to describe each facet by the three vertex names that create it. This relational point name data can then be passed in to \verb"Gudhi" if the triangulation is Delaunay.

\cprotect\subsection{Creating a Delaunay Triangulation with \verb+meshpy+}
\label{sec:implement_meshpy}
\par \verb"MeshPy" is a library that creates meshes by adapting the TetGen mesh generation program to python. As per the documentation \cite{tetgen}, Tetgen creates Delaunay triangulations by default.

\par Additional switches can be added to the code to enhance or alter the mesh. While there are dozens of possible switches to use, for simplicity, we will only be using \verb"-p" and \verb"-q".

\cprotect\subsubsection{Switch \verb+-p+}
Tetrahedralizes a piecewise linear complex (PLC). A PLC is a ...

\cprotect\subsubsection{Switch \verb+-q+}
Refines mesh to improve mesh quality by ...

\cprotect\subsection{Creating and Modifying an Alpha Complex with \verb+Gudhi+}
\par \verb"Gudhi" is a python library which contains 


\cprotect\subsection{Filtration Construction with \verb+Gudhi+}
\par By comparing the Delaunay triangulation mesh generated by \verb"MeshPy" and the alpha complex generated by \verb"Gudhi", we change the filtration values so that every original simplex from the Delaunay triangulation has a filtration value of 0 and appears in $K_{0}$, while the remaining simplices generated from the Alpha complex will retain their assigned filtration.

\subsection{Persistence Diagram Construction}
\par The function \verb"Gudhi" uses to create persistence diagrams does not display the appropriate graph when the persistence points contain only one point with a death time of $\infty$, such as the persistence diagram of the tetrahedron from Fig \ref{fig:ast_tetrahedron} below:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{center}
	    \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{tetrahedron persdia.png}
    	\caption{Persistence diagram of a tetrahedron.}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}
\par Using the \verb"Matplotlib" python library in tandem with the persistence points generated by \verb"Gudhi", we create a series of persistence diagrams to show the progression of change in the topology of variations of 3D object features.

A CAD pocket operation subtracts an area from a face. This can also create a hole which goes through an object's face. This operation was done to a cube on the top, front, and right faces to create three intersecting pockets through each face of the cube, as shown in \ref{fig:three_pocket_example}.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\section{Findings}

\section{Future Work}
\par For computational efficiency, the implementation could be improved by checking if the mesh originally contained within a 3D object file is Delaunay or not upon parsing to determine if it is necessary to create a new mesh with meshpy. Potentially eliminating this step would reduce the overall computational expense of the program.
\par The variations of the three cases of 3D objects were created manually in FreeCAD, but creating the variations could be automated. This can happen either through using the FreeCAD python library and editing the original FreeCAD .FCStd file or or by editing the text of the exported ASCII STL file to manipulate facets and vertices to change part features to simulate different tolerances.
\par The methods of this paper can be improved upon by computing a measure of topological stability to determine the error from the "truth" of an STL file through analyzing the different persistence vectors of the different versions of the file. The "truth" value of the 3D object would be the persistence vector of the preselected object and the error would be computed through the differences in the persistence vectors of the variations.
\par This paper only analyzes connected components and holes. When the \verb"MeshPy" meshes of 3D objects were created, it only triangulated the outer surfaces of objects. So when an object with a void was given to the program, it created a mesh of only the outer surface and inner surface of the void, but did not tetrahedralize the space between the two surfaces. This led to voids having a birth time not equal to $r^{2}=0$ because the voids were born as balls grew throughout the progression of the Alpha complex. The methods of this paper can also be improved through finding the correct meshing algorithm to tetrahedralize the space between surfaces in an object containing a void, as well as fully enclosed objects.
